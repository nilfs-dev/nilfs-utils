.SH NAME
lscp \- list NILFS2 checkpoints
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lscp
[\fIoptions\fP] [\fIdevice\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lscp
is a utility for displaying checkpoints or snapshots of the NILFS2
file system found in \fIdevice\fP.  When \fIdevice\fP is omitted,
\fI/proc/mounts\fP is examined to find a NILFS2 file system.
.PP
This command will fail if the \fIdevice\fP has no active mounts of a
NILFS2 file system.
