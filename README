* Required packages

 - libuuid-devel or uuid-dev
 - libmount-devel (fedora 14 and later)
 - libselinux-devel (unless you specify --without-selinux or --with-libmount)
 - libblkid-devel (unless you specify --without-blkid)

* How to compile

 $ ./configure
 $ make

To link mount.nilfs2 and umount.nilfs2 helper programs with libmount
library, install libmount-devel package and run the configure script
with --with-libmount option:

 $ ./configure --with-libmount

This option is set by default if /etc/mtab is a symlink to
/proc/mounts in your system.

If your system is a 64-bit architecture and libraries are installed
into /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib, change the library directory with
--libdir option:

 $ ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64


* Trouble shooting

If the blkid library in your environment is old and unusable to this
package, you can use --without-blkid option:

 $ ./configure --without-blkid

However, use of this option is normally not recommended because it
disables the safety check of mkfs.nilfs2 which prevents users from
unexpectedly overwriting an in-use device.

You can compile legacy mount.nilfs2 and umount.nilfs2 without support
of selinux context mount options (-o context=<context>, etc):

 $ ./configure --without-selinux

For mount.nilfs2 built with the --with-libmount option, support of
the context mount depends on the libmount library.


* How to get development sources

 $ cd your-work-directory
 $ git clone git://github.com/nilfs-dev/nilfs-utils.git

Before compiling the development sources, you need to run autogen.sh
script.  This is not required for packaged sources unless you changed
the configuration.
 
 $ cd nilfs-utils
 $ ./autogen.sh

* Developer's notes

The central resource for nilfs-utils development is the mailing list
(linux-nilfs@vger.kernel.org).

First, please read the following documents (in short, follow Linux
kernel development rules):

http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/CodingStyle
http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Then, check your patches with the patch style checker prior to
submission (scripts/checkpatch.pl) like the following example:

 $ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl <patch-file>
 ...
 <patch-file> has no obvious style problems and is ready for submission.
