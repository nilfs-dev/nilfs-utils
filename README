* Required packages

 - libuuid-devel or uuid-dev
 - libmount-devel or libmount-dev
 - libblkid-devel or libblkid-dev
 - libselinux-devel or libselinux1-dev (*1)

 *1: required only if supporting SELinux context mount options without
     using libmount.  By default, libmount is used and support of the
     context mount depends on the libmount that distro provides.

* How to compile

** From a source package (tarball): **

 $ ./configure
 $ make

** From the git repository: **

 $ git clone https://github.com/nilfs-dev/nilfs-utils.git
 $ cd nilfs-utils
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

Before compiling the development sources (git clone), you need to run
the autogen.sh script to generate the configuration files.  This is not
required for packaged sources unless you have modified build system
files such as configure.ac or Makefile.am.


* Installation path configuration

The configure script automatically probes your system to determine the
appropriate library installation directory (libdir).

- On systems using RPM-based package management (e.g., RHEL clones,
  Fedora, openSUSE):
  Detects and sets libdir according to the system's library macro
  (typically /usr/lib64 on 64-bit systems).

- On Debian-based distributions (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, etc):
  Detects and sets libdir according to the Multiarch specification
  (e.g., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu).

You can manually override this detection using the --libdir option:

 $ ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64

If you want to separate the library files into a subdirectory, specify
it as follows, for example:

 $ ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64/nilfs

Modern Linux distributions follow the "UsrMerge" or "Bin-Sbin merge"
schemes.  The configure script automatically detects the system
hierarchy and adjusts the installation paths for core binaries
(mkfs.nilfs2, mount.nilfs2, nilfs_cleanerd, etc.):

 - Legacy: Installs to /sbin
 - UsrMerge: Installs to /usr/sbin
 - Bin-Sbin merge (e.g., Fedora Rawhide): Installs to /usr/bin

When installing to /usr/bin, the build system also attempts to create
compatibility symbolic links in /usr/sbin if that directory exists on
the target system.

You can manually override this detection using the following options:

 # Force installation into /usr/bin (Bin-Sbin merge style)
 $ ./configure --enable-usrmerge=bin

 # Force installation into /usr/sbin (UsrMerge style)
 $ ./configure --enable-usrmerge=sbin

 # Force installation into the traditional /sbin
 $ ./configure --disable-usrmerge

By default, if the option is omitted, the script probes the system's
directory configuration to determine the appropriate hierarchy.  If
the option is specified without a TYPE (i.e., --enable-usrmerge), it
defaults to "sbin" (/usr/sbin) to align with standard UsrMerge
practices.

Note: This option is significant even when /sbin is a symbolic link to
/usr/sbin (i.e., the physical installation destination is the same).
It ensures that the absolute paths used by the utilities to call other
binaries are consistent with the chosen hierarchy.


* Trouble shooting

If you change the installation path (such as --libdir) or other
configuration options, old build artifacts (especially libtool's .la
files) may cause build or installation errors.  In such cases, perform
a clean build as follows:

 $ make distclean
 $ ./configure [your-new-options]
 $ make

If the blkid library in your environment is old and incompatible with
this package, you can use --without-blkid option:

 $ ./configure --without-blkid

However, use of this option is normally not recommended because it
disables the safety check of mkfs.nilfs2, which prevents users from
accidentally overwriting an in-use device.

If /etc/mtab is not a symlink to /proc/self/mounts but a regular file
in the target system, you may need to disable libmount support to
properly handle the legacy mtab file:

 $ ./configure --without-libmount

This option is primarily intended for legacy environments or
specialized configurations that still rely on a writable /etc/mtab
file.  Note that most modern distributions provide libmount as standard
and do not require this option.

You can compile the legacy mount.nilfs2 and umount.nilfs2 helpers
without support for SELinux context mount options (-o context=<context>,
etc):

 $ ./configure --without-libmount --without-selinux

For helpers built with mount library (libmount), support of the
context mount depends on the libmount that distro provides.

If you are having problems due to the missing nilfs2 disk format or
ioctl interface definition file (nilfs2_ondisk.h or nilfs2_api.h,
respectively), try installing the Linux kernel source or header file
package first.

If you still cannot install these files, or if you want to overwrite
them with files from this package, specify the
"--enable-uapi-header-install" option as an argument to the configure
script.  This will install the uapi header files included in this
package:

 $ ./configure --enable-uapi-header-install

Note that the utility package itself references bundled local header
files, so you don't need to install these files with this option to
build.


* Developer's notes

The central resource for nilfs-utils development is the mailing list
(linux-nilfs@vger.kernel.org).

First, please read the following documents (in short, follow Linux
kernel development rules):

https://docs.kernel.org/process/coding-style.html
https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html

Then, check your patches with the patch style checker prior to
submission (scripts/checkpatch.pl) like the following example:

 $ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl <patch-file>
 ...
 <patch-file> has no obvious style problems and is ready for submission.
